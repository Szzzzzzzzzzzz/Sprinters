## Description： 
My Health Record is a government application used to store information about an individual’s health. Recent years have seen a drop-in number of users for the platform. However, the use of MHR is one of the best ways for us to treat diseases. Therefore, we created a website about MHR to tell people the advantages of MHR and how to use MHR.
